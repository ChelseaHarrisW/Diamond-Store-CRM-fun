# Diamond-Store-CRM-fun
This is a project that is a showcase of my knowlage and understanding of Vanillia JavaScript functions, event listeners, and window driven click events, I also have 
been able to practice de-bugging, iteration, customizing the click events, managing my data, and utalizing state in Vanilla JavaScript to get a better understanding 
of how state flows through applications.

Below I have added an image of the proposed data flow I have created using the DrawSQL platform
