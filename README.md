# Diamond-Store-CRM-fun
This is a project that is a showcase of my knowlage and understanding of Vanillia JavaScript functions, event listeners. I also have been able to practice and grow 
a deeper knowlage of de-bugging, iteration, customizing the click events, managing my data and it's state, while utalizing state in Vanilla JavaScript to get a better understanding of how state flows through applications with working through this project.

# Below I have added an image of the proposed data flow I have created using the DrawSQL platform :

# This is also what my application produced at a minimally viable level for a refference of what the site should offer visually when served.

# To serve the project

1. open your Terminal, and Run the git clone command, followed by the SSH key which can be found when clicking the code button on the top right corner of the repository.
2. the clone is compleated, you should be able to change directories (the CD comand) into the Diamond-Store-CRM-fun project
3. When you are in the correct directory you should be free to Serve up the project on a new port (SERVE command), and paste the link to your browser. you should then see the image above

I appreciate you Reading my README. up into this point!

For all my Coder's if you would like a challange  üòé (I know you do we have to stay sharp out here üòè)

Try adding Radio buttons to the project for customers to select what type of jewlry they would like to customize (visual below):

Once the buttons are created play around to see how you can update the state of that information, and customize the output message.

# To accept my challange:

After you have cloned down the project, create a new branch, and get to work. If you have Questions, or Want to show me your version of the product you can email me.

#HappyCoding
